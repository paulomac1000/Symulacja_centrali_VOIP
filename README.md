# Voip exchange simulation

Program simulates making connections between users by using VOIP exchange. Simulation including:
-sending communicates with header compliant with SIP
-connections, disconnections, terminate connections, client busy etc
Voip exchange can handle unlimited connections by creating separate task to each of them.

One of my first c# application so it is very amateur, but everyone has to start somewhere.

Project has been made for class from "Technologie sieciowe" (network technologies) at my third semester.
Fell free if You need this project at Your task in college.
